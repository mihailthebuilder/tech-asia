The app then sends instructions to banks to initiate transfers between sender and receiver bank accounts. </p> <p> It was also developed with a set of security and privacy principles, including entering a personal UPI pin for each payment, the company noted. </p> <p> “We’re delighted to be working with five leading banks in India: ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, the State Bank of India, and Jio Payments Bank. People can send money on WhatsApp to anyone using a UPI-supported app,” Facebook said in a statement. </p> <p> The payments function is now available on the latest versions of WhatsApp’s iPhone and Android app. </p> <p> According to a press release from NPCI, the messenger service was given the approval to go live on UPI in the multi-bank model. “WhatsApp can expand its UPI user base in a graded manner starting with a maximum registered user base of 20 million in UPI,” the statement read. </p> <p> The development comes after Facebook’s US$5.7 billion bet in Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries and its digital platform Jio.

First, don’t follow the agent-based model which just digitalizes the process that offline insurance agents follow. It will be extremely costly to acquire and manage these agents in the long term. </p> <p> Second, don’t rely on an existing platform to distribute your products. It will squeeze your margins, and the platform will eventually figure out how to sell directly to customers. </p> <figure> <img src="'+t(c)+'" alt="Startup team"/> <figcaption> Ho Chi Minh City-based insurtech startup Papaya wants to become a healthcare and wellness platform for employees. / Photo credit: Papaya </figcaption> </figure> <p> When Phan founded Papaya in 2018, it took a while for his team to decide on the startup’s business model. The company previously tried selling motorbike insurance to drivers on popular Vietnamese on-demand platforms, but the demand was just not there. </p> <p> So the startup decided to settle on solving a painful experience that many people in Vietnam go through: the claims process in health insurance. Very often, customers feel cheated by insurance companies due to the confusion surrounding their exclusion policies. </p> <p> In Vietnam, Papaya is part of just a handful of insurtech startups operating in the country, partly because insurance is a traditional industry with large incumbent players. </p> <p> Last month, the company won the Tech in Asia Startup Arena Pitch Battle 2020. It previously raised pre-seed money and is now looking to raise US$1 million to further invest in automation technology and hiring. </p> <p> The sector’s total addressable market has huge potential. The government estimates that total premiums collected by insurance companies in Vietnam last year reached about 160.2 trillion Vietnamese dong (US$5.4 billion), up 20.5% year on year. That said, the penetration rate is still relatively low, as only about 8.5% of the population has a life insurance policy, according to the Vietnam Insurance Association. </p> <figure> <img src="'+t(p)+'" alt="Ho Chi Minh"/> <figcaption> People crowd hospitals in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. / Photo credit: 123rf </figcaption> </figure> <p> Phan, who previously worked for FWD Insurance, understands the painstaking process of claiming health insurance for both patients and insurance companies. It’s largely based on manual processes like filling out paperwork and sending back-and-forth emails, and the approval process might take several weeks. </p> <p> For now, Papaya only operates in the business-to-business space. Its customers consist of insurance companies which also see the benefits of speeding up their own claiming process. So far, the startup has secured contracts with two major insurance companies in the country – FWD and Bao Minh – which delegate a number of their portfolio companies for Papaya to manage. </p> <p> The company currently processes health insurance claims for 8,000 employees, who can use its mobile app to digitally check in at hospitals and clinics within the insurance companies’ network. </p> <p> According to Phan, this allows the employees to get their claims approved within 30 minutes (for claims under 3 million dong or US$130). Generally, Papaya can approve claims under 5 million dong (US$217). Those that go beyond this threshold require additional approval from insurance companies. </p> <p> The startup charges insurance companies 6% of the annual insurance premium and another 2% for using its mobile app. Following this model, Papaya expects its annual recurring revenue will reach US$250,000 this year. </p> <p> But Phan is keenly aware of the company’s limitations. Papaya has been able to automate just 10% of the claiming process – the startup’s own operations staff must check the submitted documents manually. With only four employees on the task, Papaya currently processes about 1,000 claims in a month. </p> <p> “It’s because the medical documents in Vietnam do not follow standards,” he tells Tech in Asia. “We need to invest in automation, but it’s just going to take time.” </p> <p> Additionally, Phan says the insurtech startup eventually needs to find other sources of revenue. “Claiming is still just a small market because we have to depend on the budget of insurance companies,” he adds. </p> </section> <section class="article-section" id="thailand"> <h1> Line’s delivery app in Thailand banks $110m, merges with local food app </h1> <div id="subheading"> <span>Mary Poppins | </span> <span>30 Jun 2020</span> </div> <p> Thailand’s Line Man, the on-demand assistant platform of messaging app Line, said it has reached an agreement to receive US$110 million in investment from growth capital firm BRV Capital Management. </p> <p> According to Line, this is the first time one of its entities overseas has secured an investment of this size. </p> <figure> <img src="'+t(u)+'" alt="Line man"/> <figcaption>Photo credit: Line Man</figcaption> </figure> <p> The deal comes as Line Man inked a merger with Wongnai Media, a restaurant review and discovery platform in Thailand.

Line said the merger would help it strengthen its position as the country’s leading daily assistant app. </p> <p> Line Man was launched in 2016 as Line forayed into local, on-demand services for the first time. Since then, it has added over 100,000 restaurants to its platform. </p> <p> The app offers deliveries for food, groceries, convenience store items, and parcels, along with messenger and taxi-hailing services.
