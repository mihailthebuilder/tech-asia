  <p>
    The closing of the transaction is subject to conditions and is expected to
    take place in the first half of 2021.
  </p>
  <p>
    Baidu’s acquisition of the video-based entertainment livestreaming unit will
    include the YY mobile app, the YY.com website, and PC YY, among others.
  </p>
  <p>
    With the acquisition, YY Live will have access to Baidu’s traffic and mobile
    ecosystems while the latter will receive operational experience, know-how,
    and a creator network for video-based social media development, said Robin
    Li, co-founder and CEO at Baidu.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the past year, Baidu enabled the growth of its non-advertising revenues
    by increasing log-in users and adding social engagement to their platform.
    It also expanded its non-advertising offerings, which include membership,
    livestreaming, and online games, Li noted.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Chinese tech giant also announced it has generated US$4.16 billion in
    revenue for Q3 2020, with its online market revenue from Baidu Core taking
    up US$2.72 billion. It also raked in US$2.02 billion in net income that’s
    attributable to Baidu during the period.
  </p>
  <p>
    The development comes after Tencent acquired 30 billion class B shares of
    Joyy’s Twitch-like service Huya in an US$810 million deal in August and
    became Huya’s biggest shareholder. Later, Huya acquired its rival Douyu and
    was reported to create a new game-streaming giant valued at over US$11
    billion.

  <h1>Facebook’s WhatsApp to roll out in-app payments feature in India</h1>
  <div id="subheading">

  </div>
  <p>
    After winning approval from India’s National Payments Corporation (NPCI),
    Facebook‘s WhatsApp will start rolling out its payments feature across the
    country.
  </p>
  <figure>
    <img src="./img/india.jpg" alt="WhatsApp" />

  </figure>
  <p>
    WhatsApp’s new feature allows its users to send money to other users or
    share the cost of goods through the app itself. It was designed using the
    Unified Payment Interface (UPI), an India-first real-time payment system
    that is supported by over 160 banks.
  </p>
  <p>
    To use the new payments feature, WhatsApp users must first have a bank
    account and debit card in India. The app then sends instructions to banks to
    initiate transfers between sender and receiver bank accounts.
  </p>
  <p>
    It was also developed with a set of security and privacy principles,
    including entering a personal UPI pin for each payment, the company noted.
  </p>
  <p>
    “We’re delighted to be working with five leading banks in India: ICICI Bank,
    HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, the State Bank of India, and Jio Payments Bank. People
    can send money on WhatsApp to anyone using a UPI-supported app,” Facebook
    said in a statement.
  </p>
  <p>
    The payments function is now available on the latest versions of WhatsApp’s
    iPhone and Android app.
  </p>
  <p>
    According to a press release from NPCI, the messenger service was given the
    approval to go live on UPI in the multi-bank model. “WhatsApp can expand its
    UPI user base in a graded manner starting with a maximum registered user
    base of 20 million in UPI,” the statement read.
  </p>
  <p>
    The development comes after Facebook’s US$5.7 billion bet in Indian
    conglomerate Reliance Industries and its digital platform Jio. Prior to the
    funding’s announcement, it was reported that the two companies were in talks
    to build a super app much like China’s WeChat.

    Nektar.ai, a business-to-business sales productivity startup based in
    Singapore, announced that it has raised over US$2.1 million in a seed round
    led by Nexus Venture Partners.

  <p>
    Insignia Venture Partners, Arka Venture Labs, Better Capital, and the
    Vietnam Investments Group also participated in the round, along with a host
    of individual investors. These include Five9 executive vice president of
    product management Anand Chandrasekaran, CEO of Airtel’s enterprise business
    Ganesh Lakshminarayanan, and Cisco chief growth officer Vinod Muthukrishnan,
    among others.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nektar was founded early this year by Abhijeet Vijayvergiya and Aravind Ravi
    Sulekha. Previously, Vijayvergiya worked as the president and managing
    director of Asia Pacific at cloud software firm Capillary Technologies,
    while Sulekha was the tech leader at Zendesk.
  </p>
  <p>
    “In the last decade, the investment in sales tools globally has grown by
    five times, but the average sales quota attainment has fallen 40%. According
    to Forbes, 57% of sales reps missed their numbers in 2018,” said CEO
    Vijayvergiya. His company, he said, aims to build an AI-driven sales
    productivity solution that will help revenue teams to collaborate and sales
    reps to meet their quota.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nektar connects unstructured data from sources like emails, calendars,
    LinkedIn, and Zoom to customer relationship management and then overlays
    these points with the organization’s practices and sales playbooks.
  </p>
  <p>
    The company had been initially working in stealth mode with a select list of
    early adopters. It now plans to use the new funds to further build out its
    platform, ramp up its engineering and product teams, and open up its early
    access program for general availability by next year.

    CapBay and Kenanga to form Malaysia’s first Islamic supply chain finance

  </div>
  <p>
    With its acquisition of a 49% stake in Kenanga Capital Islamic Sdn Bhd
    (KCI), Malaysian fintech startup CapBay is forming a joint venture with
    KCI’s parent company Kenanga Investment Bank Berhad (KIBB) to create
    Malaysia’s first Islamic supply chain finance fintech, according to a
    statement.
  </p>
  <p>
    The joint venture aims to “continue the effort of growing Shariah-compliant
    [businesses] and developing the Islamic finance market.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Following the acquisition, CapBay co-founder Xing Xian Ang will serve as
    KCI’s CEO. He will report to Datuk Chay Wai Leong, the group managing
    director at KIBB. Meanwhile, Dato’ Sri Mohd Mokhtar Mohd Shariff has been
    appointed as chairman of CapBay.

  </figure>
  <p>
    The new fintech firm’s aim is to help small and medium-sized enterprises
    (SMEs), contractors, and vendors obtain financing in order to supply goods
    and/or services to large corporations, the government, and government-linked
    companies (GLCs). In this way, SMEs can leverage the larger corporations’
    credit-worthiness while the latter are able to support their vendors in
    turn.
  </p>
  <p>
    Founded in 2016, CapBay is a multi-bank supply chain finance and
    peer-to-peer financing (P2P) platform. Using its payment risk scoring model,
    it predicts the risk of each transaction by conducting an analysis of
    financial statements. It also uses machine learning to assess data points
    such as its clients’ historical relationships, payments, quality of
    contracts, and other patterns.
  </p>
  <p>
    CapBay claims that its approach has allowed the company to “keep the default
    rate low” while providing financing for more unbanked and underbanked
    customers.
  </p>
  <p>
    “We have always been committed to offering our customers the solutions they
    need to advance the growth of Malaysian businesses of all sizes. I am
    confident that this partnership with KIBB will allow us to grow as an
    organization and better serve our customers as we invest in our
    infrastructure and service offering,” said Ang in a statement.
  </p>
  <p>
    CapBay claims that since 2017, it has financed more than 9,000 transactions
    amounting to more than 800 million ringgit (US$192.6 million) and has served
    over 500 SMEs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Formerly known as CapitalBay, the company raised US$477,000 in a seed round
    led by KK Fund in 2017.

  <h1>Ayannah reveals merger; new entity seeks up to $50m in series B round</h1>

  </div>
  <p>
    Philippine-based fintech startup Ayannah and Indian payments firm Electronic
    Cash and Payment Solutions (ECAP) said they have merged to form a Pan-Asian
    company that aims to provide accessible digital financial services to the
    region’s middle class.
  </p>
  <figure>

  </figure>
  <p>
    Called Ayannah Global, the new entity will be headquartered in Singapore, a
    strategic location among fast-growing markets in Southeast Asia. It also
    aims to draw from the city-state’s talent pool and forge new partnerships
    with companies there.
  </p>
  <p>
    “Both companies saw huge operational and technological synergies in their
    products and growth strategy, and a merger will enable the enlarged entity
    to better reach customers, scale up product development, and expand their
    reach within Southeast Asia,” a spokesperson for Ayannah Global told Tech in
    Asia.
  </p>
  <p>
    The company also looks to capitalize on the greater demand for open banking
    and omnichannel distribution platforms driven by the Covid-19 pandemic, the
    spokesperson added.
  </p>
  <p>
    Founded in 2010, Ayannah developed an AI-enabled platform to launch a suite
    of financial and lifestyle products and services ranging from payments,
    remittances, insurance, and telemedicine.
  </p>
  <p>
    Meanwhile, Bengaluru-based ECAPS caters to the needs of domestic migrants
    and the unbanked population in India. It enables domestic money transfers,
    utility bill payments, recharges, and travel ticketing.
  </p>
  <p>
    Together, Ayannah and ECAPS have operations in India, Indonesia, and the
    Philippines. After the merger, Ayannah Global looks to extend its reach into
    Vietnam. It expects to reach over 10 million customers in these markets
    through its mobile apps and a growing network of over 60,000 offline
    touchpoints, the new entity said.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition to the merger, the company said it will start raising money for
    its series B round on June 15. It looks to bag US$30 million to US$50
    million through the round.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ayannah’s existing backers from previous fundraising rounds include
    Wavemaker Partners, Golden Gate Ventures, and 500 Startups, as well as
    several large family offices across Asia.

    Indonesia-based iSeller, an omnichannel sales software-as-a-service player,
    announced that it has secured an undisclosed amount in its series A round of
    funding led by Singapore-based VC firm Openspace Ventures and Mandiri
    Capital, the VC arm of Bank Mandiri in Indonesia.

  <p>
    The capital injection will go toward business expansion including the
    acceleration of merchant acquisition and onboarding. The company is also
    doubling down on technology development to add additional omnichannel
    merchant solutions and features, it said in a statement.
  </p>
  <p>
    Founded in 2017, iSeller offers a cloud-based platform for omnichannel
    businesses, which integrates in-store point of sale, online storefront,
    payment processing, order fulfillment, and inventory management into a
    single interface.
  </p>
  <p>
    With increasing online distribution models and multiple payment methods in
    Indonesia, small and medium-sized enterprises are finding it hard to keep
    up.
  </p>
  <p>
    The company said it aims to help these merchants take advantage of the
    online ecosystem by providing more ways to sell and accept payment across
    online and offline channels (in-store, online, apps, and marketplaces).
    Merchants can also manage sales across branches, covering Tokopedia, Shopee,
    Lazada, GoPay, Ovo, Dana, GoSend, and GrabExpress, among others.
  </p>
  <p>
    With a pay-as-you-go subscription model, iSeller serves consumer businesses
    in sectors including retail, food and beverage, and consumer services,
    catering to clients like Geprek Bensu, Ixobox, Agung Sedayu Retail Indonesia
    (ASRI), United Bike, and Yogurtland.
  </p>
  <p>
    Despite current economic conditions, the company claims that it has doubled
    its revenue and its active merchant pool year on year and currently
    processes more than 5 million transactions a month. In fact, it attributed
    this growth to the higher online transaction volume among existing customers
    amid the pandemic’s lockdown period.

    How insurtech startup Papaya looks to digitalize Vietnam’s opaque insurance
    industry
  </h1>
  <div id="subheading">
    <span>Thu Huong Le | </span>
    <span>30 Dec 2020</span>
  </div>
  <p>
    CEO and co-founder Hung Phan has learned two important insights from
    building his insurtech startup Papaya. First, don’t follow the agent-based
    model which just digitalizes the process that offline insurance agents
    follow. It will be extremely costly to acquire and manage these agents in
    the long term.
  </p>
  <p>
    Second, don’t rely on an existing platform to distribute your products. It
    will squeeze your margins, and the platform will eventually figure out how
    to sell directly to customers.
  </p>
  <figure>
    <img src="./img/vietnam.jpg" alt="Startup team" />
    <figcaption>

      healthcare and wellness platform for employees. / Photo credit: Papaya
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    When Phan founded Papaya in 2018, it took a while for his team to decide on
    the startup’s business model. The company previously tried selling motorbike
    insurance to drivers on popular Vietnamese on-demand platforms, but the
    demand was just not there.
  </p>
  <p>
    So the startup decided to settle on solving a painful experience that many
    people in Vietnam go through: the claims process in health insurance. Very
    often, customers feel cheated by insurance companies due to the confusion
    surrounding their exclusion policies.
  </p>
  <p>
    In Vietnam, Papaya is part of just a handful of insurtech startups operating
    in the country, partly because insurance is a traditional industry with
    large incumbent players.
  </p>
  <p>
    Last month, the company won the Tech in Asia Startup Arena Pitch Battle
    2020. It previously raised pre-seed money and is now looking to raise US$1
    million to further invest in automation technology and hiring.
  </p>
  <p>
    The sector’s total addressable market has huge potential. The government
    estimates that total premiums collected by insurance companies in Vietnam
    last year reached about 160.2 trillion Vietnamese dong (US$5.4 billion), up
    20.5% year on year. That said, the penetration rate is still relatively low,
    as only about 8.5% of the population has a life insurance policy, according
    to the Vietnam Insurance Association.
  </p>
  <figure>
    <img src="./img/vietnam-2.jpg" alt="Ho Chi Minh" />

  </figure>
  <p>
    Phan, who previously worked for FWD Insurance, understands the painstaking
    process of claiming health insurance for both patients and insurance
    companies. It’s largely based on manual processes like filling out paperwork
    and sending back-and-forth emails, and the approval process might take
    several weeks.
  </p>
  <p>
    For now, Papaya only operates in the business-to-business space. Its
    customers consist of insurance companies which also see the benefits of
    speeding up their own claiming process. So far, the startup has secured
    contracts with two major insurance companies in the country – FWD and Bao
    Minh – which delegate a number of their portfolio companies for Papaya to
    manage.
  </p>
  <p>
    The company currently processes health insurance claims for 8,000 employees,
    who can use its mobile app to digitally check in at hospitals and clinics
    within the insurance companies’ network.
  </p>
  <p>
    According to Phan, this allows the employees to get their claims approved
    within 30 minutes (for claims under 3 million dong or US$130). Generally,
    Papaya can approve claims under 5 million dong (US$217). Those that go
    beyond this threshold require additional approval from insurance companies.
  </p>
  <p>
    The startup charges insurance companies 6% of the annual insurance premium
    and another 2% for using its mobile app. Following this model, Papaya
    expects its annual recurring revenue will reach US$250,000 this year.
  </p>
  <p>
    But Phan is keenly aware of the company’s limitations. Papaya has been able
    to automate just 10% of the claiming process – the startup’s own operations
    staff must check the submitted documents manually. With only four employees
    on the task, Papaya currently processes about 1,000 claims in a month.
  </p>
  <p>
    “It’s because the medical documents in Vietnam do not follow standards,” he
    tells Tech in Asia. “We need to invest in automation, but it’s just going to
    take time.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, Phan says the insurtech startup eventually needs to find other
    sources of revenue. “Claiming is still just a small market because we have
    to depend on the budget of insurance companies,” he adds.

  <p>
    Thailand’s Line Man, the on-demand assistant platform of messaging app Line,
    said it has reached an agreement to receive US$110 million in investment
    from growth capital firm BRV Capital Management.
  </p>
  <p>
    According to Line, this is the first time one of its entities overseas has
    secured an investment of this size.
  </p>
  <figure>
    <img src="./img/thailand.jpg" alt="Line man" />
    <figcaption>Photo credit: Line Man</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    The deal comes as Line Man inked a merger with Wongnai Media, a restaurant
    review and discovery platform in Thailand. According to a statement from
    Line, the capital investment aims to strengthen the newly merged entity and
    expand its development in the country.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since being founded in 2010, Wongnai currently has more than 10 million
    monthly users, carrying the largest restaurant database in Thailand with
    over 400,000 establishments in its network. Line said the merger would help
    it strengthen its position as the country’s leading daily assistant app.
  </p>
  <p>
    Line Man was launched in 2016 as Line forayed into local, on-demand services
    for the first time. Since then, it has added over 100,000 restaurants to its
    platform.
  </p>
  <p>
    The app offers deliveries for food, groceries, convenience store items, and
    parcels, along with messenger and taxi-hailing services. It currently
    operates in Bangkok and several other provinces such as Nonthaburi,
    Samutprakran, and Nakornprathom.
  </p>
  <p>
    Jayden Kang, former chief strategy officer at Line Thailand, said in an
    interview with Korea Times last year that the company aims to extend its
    reach into 17 more regions in the country in the coming years, adding that
    Line Man would continue to focus on the local market rather than expanding
    overseas.
  </p>
  <p>
    BRV is a regional growth capital firm that led early rounds in PayPal and
    Waze. According to the statement, the company decided to invest in Line Man
    because of the app’s success in becoming a “daily assistant” to local users.
